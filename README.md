## üèôÔ∏è Building Tomorrow's Apps from the Heart of Cairo

I'm a passionate developer who believes that great software starts with understanding real problems. Currently deep in the trenches of mobile development, turning caffeine into code and ideas into applications that people actually want to use.

### üöÄ What I'm Building Right Now

**MyPortal** - A comprehensive university portal that's actually intuitive (revolutionary, I know). Think of it as the student management system that doesn't make you want to throw your laptop out the window. Built with Flutter because native performance shouldn't be a luxury.

### üéØ My Current Learning Adventure

I'm on a mission to master the art of crafting mobile experiences that feel native, perform beautifully, and solve real problems. Currently diving deep into:
- **Flutter & Dart** - Because cross-platform shouldn't mean compromise
- **Advanced app architecture** - Clean code isn't just a buzzword
- **User experience design** - Code is poetry, but UI is the stage

### üí° What Gets Me Excited

I live for those "aha!" moments when complex problems meet elegant solutions. Whether it's optimizing database queries, crafting smooth animations, or debugging that one issue that's been haunting me for hours - I find beauty in the process of building software that matters.

**Ask me about:**
- Object-Oriented Programming (I might get a bit too excited about design patterns)
- Mobile app architecture that scales
- That time I spent 6 hours debugging only to find a missing semicolon
- Why I think Flutter is the future of mobile development

### üèÜ Competitive Programming Journey

When I'm not building apps, you'll find me solving algorithmic puzzles and sharpening my problem-solving skills:
- **Codeforces:** [@moazweewee](https://codeforces.com/profile/moazweewee) - Where I battle algorithms daily
- **LeetCode:** [@moaaz_mohamed](https://www.leetcode.com/moaaz_mohamed) - Grinding through data structures and algorithms

### ü§ù Let's Connect and Build Something Amazing

I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push boundaries and solve real problems. Whether you're looking for a mobile developer, want to discuss the latest in tech, or just want to geek out about clean code practices, I'm your guy!
